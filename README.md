# time_steps_prediction
This analysis is focused on lesser black-backed gulls, commonly known as seabirds, which exhibit diverse migration strategies and may have potentially altered migration strategies in response to human activities driving climate change. The seabirds' movements were captured throughout their annual cycle, and trade-offs between four migration strategies were compared. The annual cumulative distance travelled by long-distance migrants wintering in West Africa, over 4000 km from their breeding colony, did not differ significantly from individuals from the same breeding colony wintering only a few hundred kilometres away in Great Britain. Short-distance migrants returned to the colony first, and long-distance migrants returned last.
The dataset contains 11 attributes: bird ID, bird year, destination, date, time, longitude and latitude, cumulative distance, and colony distance.


Data Visualisation

This analysis was carried out using the Python programming language, and the diagrams below represent an exploratory view of the data. The two coordinate columns, longitude and latitude, will be our primary focus for predictions.

The exploratory went to show 19 unique bird IDs and 4 unique destinations below.
